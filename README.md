# soloBOT

## Info

soloBOT is a bot I made to replace the 5+ bots that most servers seem to have on them. It is meant to be the only bot that you need for your server. I am still adding commands to the bot, and if you have any ideas, (no matter how niche) feel free to suggest them! Please see [my contact info](#contact)

Credit to pikisuperstar for the background used for the !level command.
