# DEPRECATED
This repository has been archived because the code is bad, hard to maintain, and out of place.

The Qev codebase itself was horribly written (because it was my first ever big project),
so I decided to rewrite it completely.
This then became "Why not make a framework for everyone?", and thus the (currently named) NJCF framework was born.

Realistically, NJCF should've been a separate codebase, but my excuse at the time was
"I don't have a name for it, so I'm going to put off making a new repo for now!", which really was stupid.

I am now going to be deleting all the code here, but the commit history will remain.
This is because I wish to let people know that the code here is dogshit, and you probably shouldn't look at it for reference.
When I create the new Qev repository, or a new bot, I will link that here.
