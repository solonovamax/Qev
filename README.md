# soloBOT
 
When I was making this bot I decided that I could do 1 of 2 things. I could either take the simple, normal, and easy route of just individually adding commands to the bot,
OR I could spend 10 hours making a overly complex, time consuming, system to add commands for me, as long as the extends AbstractCommand, and are in the commands package.

And now we have this modular bot which allows you to add commands by putting them in the commands package.

(It actually wasn't 10 hours. I managed to do it in like 3, but still.)
